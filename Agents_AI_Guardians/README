Financial Trading Agent System
This project implements a multi-agent system for financial trading analysis, strategy development, execution, and risk management. The agents collaborate to provide comprehensive insights, generate optimal trading strategies, assess risks, and recommend execution plans, tailored to the stock selection and preferences provided by the user.

Installation
To set up the environment, install the required libraries using the following command:

bash
Copy code
!pip install crewai==0.28.8 crewai_tools==0.1.6 langchain_community==0.0.29
Configuration
Configure API keys for accessing external services by setting environment variables as follows:

python
Copy code
import os
from google.colab import userdata

os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = userdata.get('SERPER_API_KEY')
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = userdata.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')

Usage
To initiate the process, define input parameters and start the agents as shown below:

python
Copy code
from crewai import Crew, Process
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Define the crew
financial_trading_crew = Crew(
    agents=[data_analyst_agent, trading_strategy_agent, execution_agent, risk_management_agent],
    tasks=[data_analysis_task, strategy_development_task, execution_planning_task, risk_assessment_task],
    manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0.7),
    process=Process.hierarchical,
    verbose=True
)

# Example input
financial_trading_inputs = {
    'stock_selection': 'AAPL',
    'initial_capital': '100000',
    'risk_tolerance': 'Medium',
    'trading_strategy_preference': 'Day Trading',
    'news_impact_consideration': True
}

# Start the process
result = financial_trading_crew.kickoff(inputs=financial_trading_inputs)
Example Output
The kickoff method will trigger the multi-agent system, and each agent will complete its assigned task. The output includes insights, strategy recommendations, execution plans, and risk analysis reports based on the given inputs.
